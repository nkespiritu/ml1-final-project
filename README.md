# *Tip mo ba ako?* A Tip Recommender System to Influence Passenger Tipping Behavior of Taxis and Ridesharing Platforms

Ridesharing platforms, such as Uber and Lyft, were fine with passengers not providing tips to their riders, because tipping undermines the dynamic pricing scheme of these companies. The issue lies when drivers would go to where the tips are. This study would try to uncover opportunities for ridesharing platforms and drivers are not experiencing compared to their taxi counterparts. Our group created two models in order to conduct this study. One is a classifier to know if a passenger would give a tip and another model to predict the tip amount. The best model for classification was Logistic Regression that had a test accuracy of 97.62%. Moreover, Ridge Regression with an accuracy of 77.07% and RMSE of USD 1.51 was the best regressor to predict the tip amount. These models can impact passenger tipping behavior by determining if a passenger would tip and suggest a tip price to them. TNP platforms can fully maximize the models given the vast amounts of data they have and a set platform. Taxi industries, on the other hand, the need to modernize their business models must be done for the models to be leveraged properly.
